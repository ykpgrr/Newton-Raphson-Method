# Newton-Raphson-Method
 Newton Raphson Method on MATLAB

Question 1: a) Consider the following objective function 
min f(x)=(x−1)^2(x−2)(x−3) , 0 <= x <=4

 i) Use the method of Newton-Raphson to compute x* that minimizes f (x) for the following 
three initial values of x0 = 0.2,1.5 and 2.5 with 10−10 tolerance.(Write matlab m-file code)
